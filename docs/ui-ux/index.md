# AI Chatbot UI/UX Implementation

## Overview

This documentation details the UI/UX implementation for the AI Chatbot application. It provides comprehensive guidelines, component specifications, and implementation roadmaps for creating a cohesive, accessible, and responsive user interface.

## Tech Stack

The UI is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn/UI**: Component library built on Tailwind and Radix
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Lucide**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Documentation Sections

- Testing functionality

### 6. [Organization Settings](./organization-settings.md)

Detailed breakdown of the Organization Settings screens:

- User management
- Subscription and billing
- API access
- Integrations
- Role-based access control

## Implementation Approach

Our UI implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Component-First**: Building a robust library of reusable components
2. **Accessibility-Driven**: Ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start
3. **Mobile-First**: Designing for mobile and scaling up to larger screens
4. **Theme-Agnostic**: Supporting both light and dark modes seamlessly
5. **Performance-Oriented**: Optimizing for performance with code splitting and lazy loading

## Monorepo Structure

The UI components are organized within a monorepo architecture:

```bash
├── apps/
│   └── web/               # Main web application using the UI components
└── packages/
    ├── ui/                # Shared UI components library
    ├── api/               # API client and utilities
    ├── database/          # Database schemas and client
    └── ...                # Other packages
```

### UI Package Organization

The UI package follows atomic design principles:

```bash
packages/ui/
├── src/
│   ├── styles/            # Design tokens and themes
│   ├── lib/               # Utility functions
│   ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
│   └── components/        # UI components
│       ├── ui/            # Atomic components
│       ├── forms/         # Form components
│       ├── layout/        # Layout components
│       ├── navigation/    # Navigation components
│       └── composite/     # Complex components
└── package.json
```

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Compound Components**: Related components grouped together for complex patterns
2. **Controlled Components**: State-driven components with clear prop interfaces
3. **Composition**: Favoring composition over inheritance for component reuse
4. **Render Props**: Using render props for flexible component customization
5. **Context Providers**: For global state and theme management

## Development Workflow

1. **Component First**: Develop core UI components in the packages/ui directory
2. **Storybook**: Document and test components in isolation
3. **Integration**: Integrate components into application screens
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for components
5. **Optimization**: Performance optimization and accessibility audits

## Next Steps

1. Set up the UI package with Tailwind configuration
2. Implement design tokens and core components
3. Create screen layouts and navigation
4. Develop complex interactive components
5. Integration with backend APIs
