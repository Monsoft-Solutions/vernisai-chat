# UI/UX Implementation Overview

## Tech Stack

The UI for the AI Chatbot application will be implemented using the following technologies:

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TanStack Router**: Type-safe routing with file-based routing support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn/UI**: Component library built on Tailwind and Radix
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Lucide**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Monorepo Architecture

The application follows a monorepo architecture with the following structure:

```bash
├── apps/
│   └── web/               # Main web application
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── routes/    # TanStack Router file-based routes
│       │   ├── pages/     # Page components (if not in routes)
│       │   └── components/# App-specific components
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                # Shared UI components
│   │   ├── src/

│   ├── database/          # Database schemas and client
│   ├── typescript-config/ # Shared TypeScript configurations

└── docs/
    ├── ui-ux/             # UI/UX documentation
    └── ...                # Other documentation
```

## UI Component Strategy

All reusable UI components will be implemented in the `packages/ui` directory. These components will be:

1. **Atomic**: Following atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
2. **Accessible**: Compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. **Responsive**: Adapt to all screen sizes
4. **Theme-aware**: Support for light and dark modes
5. **Well-documented**: Props, usage examples, and design considerations

## Routing Strategy

The application uses TanStack Router for type-safe routing with the following benefits:

1. **File-based Routing**: Routes are defined by file structure in `apps/web/src/routes/`
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for route parameters and data
3. **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better performance
4. **Data Loading**: Built-in data loading and prefetching capabilities
5. **Dev Tools**: Integrated router devtools for debugging

Route structure follows these conventions:

- `__root.tsx`: Root layout with navigation
- `index.tsx`: Home page route
- `$param.tsx`: Dynamic route parameters
- `_layout.tsx`: Nested layouts (when needed)

## Implementation Roadmap

The UI implementation will follow this roadmap:

1. **Design System Setup** (Week 1)

   - Configure Tailwind theme
   - Set up Shadcn/UI components
   - Create core design tokens
   - Configure TanStack Router

2. **Core Components Implementation** (Week 2)

   - Layout components
   - Navigation components
   - Form components
   - Route structure setup

3. **Screen Implementation** (Weeks 3-4)

   - Dashboard
   - Chat Interface
   - Agent Builder
   - Organization Settings

4. **Responsive Design & Accessibility** (Week 5)

   - Mobile optimization
   - Accessibility audit and fixes
   - Performance optimization

5. **Testing & Documentation** (Week 6)
   - Component testing
   - Integration testing
   - Documentation completion
   - Route testing

## Component Documentation Standards

Each component in the UI package should include:

1. **Component Definition**: TypeScript interface/type for props
2. **Usage Examples**: Basic and advanced usage examples
3. **Accessibility Considerations**: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation
4. **Responsive Behavior**: How the component adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Variants**: Different visual and functional variants

## Integration Guidelines

When integrating UI components into the application:

1. Import components from the ui package (`@vernisai/ui`)
2. Follow the established design patterns
3. Maintain consistency with the design system
4. Leverage Tailwind utility classes for custom styling when needed
5. Use TanStack Router's type-safe APIs for navigation
6. Follow file-based routing conventions for new routes
