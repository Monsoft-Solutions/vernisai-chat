# VernisAI AI Package Documentation and Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document details the AI library that will drive all logic related to AI, assistants, and agents. It is designed to support both a ChatGPT-like conversational UI and advanced, agent-based workflows. The system leverages Vercel’s [ai-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai) for AI operations (using models from OpenAI and Anthropic) and is built for extensibility. It also integrates knowledge bases to provide additional context to agents, making it a versatile solution for both general users and complex workflows (e.g., similar to Zapier or AutoGen).

Additionally, all logs and telemetry data will be captured using [LangFuse](https://langfuse.com/), running on our own server. This integration will provide insights into usage patterns, performance, and error tracking.

    - Allow users to upload or link documents, files, URLs, or cloud storage accounts (e.g., Google Drive).
  - **Contextual Linking:**
    - Enable linking one or more knowledge bases to an agent.
    - Update knowledge bases automatically after interactions, tool actions, or via scheduled tasks.

- **Action Items:**
  - Develop ingestion pipelines to process various content sources.
  - Implement API endpoints to link and retrieve context from knowledge bases.
  - Set up automatic update triggers (e.g., using cron jobs or serverless functions).

---

### 1.4 Telemetry and Logging Integration (LangFuse)

- **Purpose:**  
  Capture logs and telemetry data across the AI system to monitor usage, performance, and errors.

- **Key Functionalities:**
  - **Logging Integration:**
    - Integrate LangFuse SDK with the Vercel AI SDK.
    - Collect detailed logs from Chatbot UI, Agent workflows, and Knowledge Base modules.
  - **Telemetry Monitoring:**
    - Monitor performance metrics and error tracking.
    - Enable real-time analysis and alerts for system issues.
- **References:**

  - [LangFuse Vercel AI SDK Integration Documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/vercel-ai-sdk)
  - [LangFuse Homepage](https://langfuse.com/)

- **Action Items:**
  - Set up LangFuse on a dedicated server.
  - Integrate LangFuse hooks into all major components.
  - Develop dashboards and alerting mechanisms for real-time monitoring.
