## Implementation Roadmap

For a comprehensive view of the planned development phases and features, see the [Platform Roadmap](./roadmap.md).

## Getting Started

For new developers joining the project, we recommend starting with the [Technical Overview](./core-architecture/01-technical-overview.md) to understand the system's architecture and components, followed by the [Database Schema](./core-architecture/02-database-schema.md) to understand the data model.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices, avoiding the use of `any` types
- Implement consistent error handling throughout the application
- Write unit and integration tests for all new features
- Document API changes in the OpenAPI specification
- Follow the UI design system for consistent user experience
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all UI components

## Contribution Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement the feature with appropriate tests
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Address review comments
6. Merge after approval
