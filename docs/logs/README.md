# System Logging Implementation

This document outlines the logging strategy for VernisAI Chat application, covering both client-side and server-side implementations.

## Overview

A comprehensive logging system is essential for:

- Tracking and debugging errors
- Monitoring system performance
- Understanding user behavior
- Ensuring system security
- Supporting compliance requirements

## Documentation Structure

For detailed implementation guides, refer to the following documentation:

1. [Client-Side Logging with Sentry](./client-side-logging.md)
2. [Server-Side Logging with Winston and Better Stack](./server-side-logging.md)

## Architecture Overview

The VernisAI Chat logging system consists of two main components:

1. **Client-Side Logging**: Implemented using Sentry to track front-end errors, performance issues, and user interactions in the browser.

2. **Server-Side Logging**: Implemented using Winston integrated with Better Stack for structured logging, centralized collection, and real-time monitoring.

## Implementation Comparison

| Aspect       | Client-Side (Sentry)        | Server-Side (Winston + Better Stack) |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Focus        | Browser errors, performance | API requests, application events     |
| Data Capture | Stack traces, breadcrumbs   | Structured JSON logs                 |
| User Context | Browser, device, user info  | Session, auth context                |
| Storage      | Sentry Cloud                | Better Stack Cloud                   |
| Retention    | Configurable in Sentry      | Configurable in Better Stack         |
| Analysis     | Sentry UI/Dashboard         | Better Stack UI/Dashboard            |

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Implement client-side Sentry integration
2. Set up server-side Winston logging
3. Integrate Winston with Better Stack transport
4. Configure log levels for different environments
5. Implement request logging middleware
6. Add error handling with proper logging
7. Set up alerts and monitoring
8. Document logging standards and best practices
