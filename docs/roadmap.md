## Success Criteria

Each phase will be considered complete when:

1. All specified features are implemented and tested
2. User feedback has been collected and incorporated
3. Documentation has been updated to reflect new capabilities
4. Performance and security requirements have been met

This roadmap is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on user feedback and emerging technologies. Priority should be given to features that deliver immediate value to users while building toward the long-term vision of a comprehensive no-code agent platform.
